	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Richardson&apos;s<i> Moral Sentiments</i> emerged from a long history of commonplacing, a practice popularized in the 17th century. Readers would find passages and maxims in their novels, plays, and essays to copy into their commonplace books, at times organizing them into alphabetized topics. As David Allen explains in <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Commonplace_Books_and_Reading_in_Georgia/lkVAC5EV_3UC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank"><i>Commonplace Books and Reading in Georgian England</i></a> (2010), commonplace books were originally kept in ancient Greece and Renaissance Europe so that scholars could carefully “harvest” quotations from their reading, which they would later employ in oral and written arguments (36). The tradition, then, was “firmly grounded in the technical concerns of the logician” (38).</p>
	<p>By the 18th century, however, commonplace books had became more popular, especially in non-scholarly settings and among women, and the notion of their use also shifted. As St Clair notes in <i>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</i> (2004), readers collected maxims because they considered them as bits of wisdom “regarded as universally and perennially true” (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1y3bS3Z0uY0C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=st+clair+universally+and+perennially+true&source=bl&ots=cxU-cEWP7V&sig=ACfU3U14hVSt_TZIxF7SRbgDHW5YKmzkLg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUi8yuwpXoAhWNhHIEHfAWCu8Q6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=st%20clair%20universally%20and%20perennially%20true&f=false" target="_blank">68</a>). Readers copied and re-read maxims to collect <i>moral</i> wisdom, and so that they could apply the maxims’ sage advice to their everyday lives.</p>
	<p>Kennicott&apos;s preface builds on this tradition, claiming that the book of maxims will “animate man to act up to his genuine greatness” (viii). In doing so, he suggests that the “universally” true maxims would help guide the reader in living a moral life.</p>
	<p>In <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, then, Richardson was offering a printed, mass-produced collection of maxims born from a well-established manuscript tradition. Rather than aid its readers in memory or argumentation, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> was devised - like the commonplace books of its time - to assist its readers in exhibiting proper behavior and moral action.</p>
