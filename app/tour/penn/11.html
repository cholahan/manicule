	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>Richardson&apos;s<i> Moral Sentiments</i> emerged from a long history of commonplacing, a practice popularized in the 17th century. Readers would find passages and maxims in their novels, plays, and essays to copy into their commonplace books, at times organizing them into alphabetized topics. As David Allen explains in <a href= "https://www.google.com/books/edition/Commonplace_Books_and_Reading_in_Georgia/lkVAC5EV_3UC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank"><i>Commonplace Books and Reading in Georgian England</i></a> (2010), commonplace books from ancient Greece and Renaissance Europe were originally kept so that scholars could carefully “harvest” quotations that would later be employed in oral and written arguments (36). The tradition, then, was “firmly grounded in the technical concerns of the logician” (38).</p>
	<p>By the 18th century, however, when the commonplace book became more popular, especially in less scholarly settings and among women, the notion of its use also shifted. As St Clair notes in <i>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</i> (2004), readers collected maxims because they regarded them as bits of wisdom “regarded as universally and perennially true” (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1y3bS3Z0uY0C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=st+clair+universally+and+perennially+true&source=bl&ots=cxU-cEWP7V&sig=ACfU3U14hVSt_TZIxF7SRbgDHW5YKmzkLg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUi8yuwpXoAhWNhHIEHfAWCu8Q6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=st%20clair%20universally%20and%20perennially%20true&f=false”target="_blank">68</a>). Readers were told to copy and re-read maxims so that they could collect <i>moral</i> wisdom, and so they could apply the maxims’ sage advice to their everyday lives.</p>
	<p>Kennicott&apos;s preface builds on this tradition, claiming that the book of maxims will “animate man to act up to his genuine greatness” (viii). In doing so, he suggests that the “universally” true maxims would guide the reader through their life.</p>
	<p>In <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, then, Richardson was offering a printed, mass-produced collection of maxims born from a well-established manuscript tradition.</p>
