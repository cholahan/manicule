	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>Richardson&apos;s<i>Moral Sentiments</i> emerged from a long history of commonplacing, a practice popularized in the 17th century. Readers would find passages and maxims in their novels, plays, and essays to copy into their commonplace books, at times organizing them into alphabetized topics. As St Clair notes in <i>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</i> (2004), readers collected maxims because they regarded them as bits of wisdom “regarded as universally and perennially true” (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1y3bS3Z0uY0C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=st+clair+universally+and+perennially+true&source=bl&ots=cxU-cEWP7V&sig=ACfU3U14hVSt_TZIxF7SRbgDHW5YKmzkLg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUi8yuwpXoAhWNhHIEHfAWCu8Q6AEwAHoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&q=st%20clair%20universally%20and%20perennially%20true&f=false”target="_blank">68</a>).</p>
	<p>These "univerally" true maxims were meant to guide the reader through their life and be 'applied' to everyday situations. Kennicott&apos;s preface builds on this tradition, claiming that the book of maxims will “animate man to act up to his genuine greatness” (viii).</p>
	<p>In <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, then, Richardson was offering a printed, mass-produced collection of maxims born from a well-established manuscript tradition.</p>
