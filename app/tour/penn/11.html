	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>This project emerged, then, out of a long history of commonplacing, in which readers would collect maxims or ‘sentiments’ from novels, plays, essays, and other texts to copy into their commonplace books, only some of which were organized and indexed as Richardson’s printed version is. These maxims were then meant to be ‘applied’ to one’s own life. Kennicott writes in the Preface of this “plan on which the following Maxims are grounded; namely, on <i>the real dignity of human nature</i>, in order to animate man to act up to his genuine greatness” (viii).</p>
	<p>In <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, Richardson was offering a printed, mass-produced collection of maxims born from this manuscript tradition.</p>.
