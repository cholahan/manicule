	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>The work also exhibits Richardson’s desire to guide and even control readers of his novels. On the footnote on this page, for example, Richardson attempts to ‘correct’ the readings of those who, upon reading his novel, wished that Clarissa <i>had</i> married Lovelace.</p>
	<p>At the end of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, Richardson also includes <a href=416 target="_blank">two letters</a> which he wrote to readers commenting on <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>: one, explaining why he did not, and will not, add an additional volume to the end of the novel, and a second, justifying why Grandison had agreed to raise his children catholic if he had married Lady Clementina. From these editorial interventions, we can also conjecture that Richardson crafted <i>Moral Sentiments</i> to, in part, control how his readers interpreted, and drew moral lessons from, his novels.</p>
	<p>The footnote reads:</p>
	<p><i>“These three articles are recommended to the consideration of those who would have had Clarissa to marry Lovelace, after his outrage on her honour. The doctrine inculcated in them was what he depended on, and was what encouraged him to commit the outrage. It was necessary that he should be convinced of his mistake. The conviction was given by Clarissa; and his utter ruin was the consequence of his atrocious guilt”</i> (159).</p>
