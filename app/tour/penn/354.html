	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>On this page, in quotations under “Miscellaneous <i>Observations,”</i> we find the sentiment:</p>
	<p><i>“The eye and the ear are too often great misleaders”</i></p>
	<p>The quotation is extracted from the second volume of <i>Grandison,</i> on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=138" target="_blank">pp. 130,</a> from a passage that reads:
	<p>“His good-sense and his politeness, and the pride he took to be thought one of the best-bred men in England, secured her <i>complaisant</i> treatment. But Lady Grandison had qualities that deserved one of the best and tenderest of men. Her eye and her ear had certainly misled her.”
	<p>Richardson shortens the observation into a more quotable and memorable statement; in doing so, however, the maxim might also become less clear in its moral lesson on vanity, a lesson that is so succinctly <i>demonstrated</i> by Lady Grandison’s actions.</p>
