	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>The division of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> by novel also suggests that Richardson believed he could not fully separate the moral lessons from their novel contexts — despite his best effort to do so in this work. To read the sentiments from <i>Clarissa</i>, for example, one would need to be at least cursorily aware of the novel's plots and characters to know that Lovelace is a bad model of character and thus to know how to read the sentiments that reference him.</p>
	<p>It is possible that he also imagined the readers of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> to turn to specific novels for specific advice. Many of the topics tend to reflect the novels from which they are ‘extracted’. For example, the section on “Duty” from <i>Clarissa</i> here discusses, for the most part, the duty of children to their parents. The section on <a href=34 target="_blank">“Duty”</a> from <i>Pamela</i>, in contrast, discusses a servant’s duty to their superiors (or, at times, lack thereof). This suggests that Richardson imagined that the readers of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> were already intimately familiar with his novels — they would know which novel to turn to for advice on different forms of duty.</p>
