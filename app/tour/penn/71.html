	<h3><i>Playing with format</i></h3>
	<p>Richardson also broke up similar topics over multiple headings in order to guide the reader to certain conclusions or topics. In the <i>Pamela</i> section, for instance, there are multiple sections on poverty. If a reader were to look under ‘Po’ for Poor or Poverty they would find a section entitled <a href=“71” target="_blank">Poor <i>not to be despised by the Rich</i></a>, a section aimed at the <i>wealthy</i>, rather than the poor. The book thus guides the reader towards a specific moral ‘instruction’ that is not necessarily directly in line with their original search.</p>
	<p>We also see that there are similar quotations and sentiments across the many topics that address social class directly. From the section on <a href=”62“ target=”_blank”>Low Life,</a> we find the quotation:</p>
	<img src="images/ms_8.png" alt="Highlight from page." style="width:100%;height:auto;">
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>In the section on <a href=”62“ target=”_blank”>The Rich,</a>, we find a similar quotation:</p>
	<img src="images/ms_9.png" alt="Quotation from ‘The Rich’." style="width:100%;height:auto;">
	<p>Ostensively, because it is an important ‘moral’ addressed in the original novel, the book offers the reader multiple paths through which to reach it.</p>
	<p>We can see a similar case in the <i>Grandison</i> section. Likely because a critique of duelling is so central to the novel, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> includes three separate topics on duelling: <a href=”248“ target=”_blank”>Challenges</a>, <a href=”265“ target=”_blank”>Duelling</a>, and <a href=”282“ target=”_blank”>Fencing</a>. By breaking a singular topic into multiple headings, dispersed throughout the <i>Grandison</i> section, Richardson increases the likeliness of a reader finding (and reading) its moral lesson. </p>
