	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
  <p>Approximately 75% of the subjects in <i>Grandison</i> and <i>Pamela</i> cross-reference another section (107 out of the total 142 headings in <i>Grandison</i> and 92 out of the 122 sections in <i>Pamela</i>). In <i>Clarissa</i>, the first novel that Richardson ‘commonplaced’, only 26% of the headings cross-reference another topic. In addition to the fact that the <i>Clarissa</i> section has fewer cross-references overall (275 total, compared to the 372 in <i>Pamela</i> and 674 in <i>Grandison</i>), they seem to be clustered under certain subjects.</p>
	<p>Given that Richardson reproduced much of the <i>Clarissa</i> section from the 1751 appendix version, it is likely that the cross-references were added <i>afterwards,</i> and only to a select few subject sections, while the cross-references for <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Grandison</i> were produced during the compilation process. This suggests that as Richardson was creating the collection of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, the cross-references and networked nature of the work became more critical to his project.</p>
