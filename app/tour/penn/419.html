	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>In one of the letters that Richardson attaches at the end of the work, he clarifies that his novels, while touching on similar broad topics—-in each novel section, for example, we get sections on “Love” and “Beauty”-—were written to address different issues. Richardson claims that he does not continue his novel <i>Grandison</i> to include section on parenting because he has already addressed this in his earlier <i>Pamela</i>:</p>
	<p>“As to what you are pleased to hint of the Hero’s appearing to shine in the parental character, have I not in PAMELA entered into that subject pretty largely? And have I not in this history avoided touching upon the same topics that I have treated on in either of the two former?” (406).</p>
