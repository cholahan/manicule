	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>Richardson might have kept <i>Moral Sentiments</i> divided by novel simply because he thought that each novel taught unique lessons.  In one of the letters that Richardson attaches at the end of the work, he clarifies that his novels, while touching on some similar topics, were written to address different issues. In this letter, Richardson claims that he does not continue his novel <i>Grandison</i> to include later volumes on Grandison&apos;s parenting because he has already addressed parenting and education in his earlier <i>Pamela</i>. In the letter found on this page, he writes,</p>
	<p><i>“As to what you are pleased to hint of the Hero’s appearing to shine in the parental character, have I not in PAMELA entered into that subject pretty largely? And have I not in this history avoided touching upon the same topics that I have treated on in either of the two former?”</i></p>
