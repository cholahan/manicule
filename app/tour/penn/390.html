	<h2>5. Beyond the Maxim: In conclusion</h2>
	<p>Richardson's <i>Moral Sentiments,</i> then, is more than just a printed, mass-produced commonplace book.</p>
	<p>At the surface level, it teaches its readers <i>how</i> to read novels — for the moral, rather than the story — by doing that very work for the reader. On this page, under “Sentiments,” Richardson admonishes the English reader that prefers the plot over its moral lessons:</p>
	<p><i>“The French, at this day, are more fond of Sentiments in their author writings, than the English,</i></p>
	<p><i>Story, in works of imagination, is what the English hunt after, whether probable or improbable.”</i></p>
	<p>Implicitly, the work also teaches its readers how to commonplace themselves, showing how longer texts can be chopped into shorter sentiments and sanctioning, it seems, the copying, repitition, and rearrangement of its own sentiments in further forms. In this way, we might understand <i>Moral Sentiments</i> as a retooling  Locke's <i>Method of a Common-place-book</i>.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> also instructs its readers, more broaldy, in how to read desultorily: the text constantly urging the reader to skip through its pages non-linearally and return to passages from Richardson's novels again and again. In the framing of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, one never really <i>finishes</i> reading a novel like <i>Pamela</i>, because the reader is expected to distill its lessons into their daily life and return to the book for bites of wisdom, long meditative passages, and models of character.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> is also an interpretive guide to <i>Pamela, Clarissa</i>, and <i>Grandison</i>. It attempts to control how the reader interprets and forms opinions on Richardson's novels, even down to opinions on small plot points, such as Grandison hypothetically allowing his chidlren to be raised Catholic in the case of a possible marraige.</p>
	<p>Finally, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> doesn't just offer a “guide” to living morally: it also teaches its readers — and especially its young female readers — how to understand, read, and navigate within their society, from identifying libertines and their persuasive logistical tricks to understanding their future husband's perspective on their wedding night. Richardson's book is as much of a guide to understanding a rapdily-changing society, then, as it to living a virtuous life.</p>
