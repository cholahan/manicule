	<h2>5. Beyond the Maxim</h2>
	<p>In addition to offering knowledgeable maxims and models of good and bad behavior, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> attempts to teach its readers <i>how</i> to read, and interpret, language.</p>
	<p>Just as Richardson offers his readers libertine rhetoric as a way for them to recognize and avoid libertines, he offers “Signs of Love” in <i>Sir Charles Grandison.</i> The section offers ways for its reader to identify a man or woman in love (such as “sparkl[ing] eyes” and “glow[ing] cheeks”), as well as for a reader to identify love within <i>themselves</i>. For example, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> offers the following advice for its female readers:</p>
	<p><i>“When a young woman finds both pleasure and pain in sighing, she should look to her heart,</i>” <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142157&view=1up&seq=73"target="_blank">iv. 63.</a> [235]. (379).</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i>, then, teaches readers to identify language and other clues <i>within</i> the novel as a way to teach them how to read <i>outside</i> the novel.</p>
