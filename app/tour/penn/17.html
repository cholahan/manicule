	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>In these cases where the 'sentiments' are summaries of passages or observations on entire scenes, Richardson is identifying the moral lesson that he <i>wants</i> his readers to take away from the novels. Take, for example, the maxim:</p>
	<p><i>Wicked men will stoop to the most degrading meanness to obtain a favourite end” </i><p>
	<p>This maxim is taken from  <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201717&view=1up&seq=314"target="_blank">page 270</a> of the first volume of <i>Pamela</i>, from a scene in which Mr. B dresses up as a female servant and pretends to fall asleep in Pamela’s closet while she is undressing. By offering these summaries, Richardson uses his <i>Moral Sentiments</i> as a way to interpret the novel <i>for</i> his readers: to control, in other words, how they construe, and learn from, the fictional scenes they read.</p>
