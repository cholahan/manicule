	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>Despite the multiple tools that Richardson employs to create a network, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> remains divided by novel; a section on “virtue” in <i>Clarissa</i>, for example, would never link to a section on virtue in <i>Pamela</i> or <i>Grandison</i>. Even the index remains divided by novel.</p>
