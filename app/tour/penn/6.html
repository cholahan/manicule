	<p>To add more tour stops, create an HTML file like this one, with a basic div container. Name it using the index number of the page you'd like to attach the tour stop to. (The index of the left page showing on any spread is the number at the end of the URL above; add one for the right page.) Upload the file to the directory: /tour/{name of your book &mdash; the default in the reader is "penn"}/</p>
	<p>Be sure to update the tour.json file in the same folder, which orders the tour. A tour can zigzag non-linearly across a book, but you must update the JSON file.</p>
