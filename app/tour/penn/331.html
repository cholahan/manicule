	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>In addition, Richardson includes an elaborate network of cross-references within each novel section. At the end of each subject section, the editor suggests other subjects that the reader might refer to; for example, at the end of the maxims on “Duty. Obedience” in Clarissa, the editor also advises the reader to also “<i>See</i> Parents <i>and Children</i>” (119). In some sections, the cross-referencing can become quite elaborate, as is evident by the 32 referenced subjects at the end of the section on “Love” in Grandison. These references encourage the reader to read non-linearly, flipping to different sections of the book as they reference back to the original novels.</p>

	<p>The suggestions always refer to other sections within that particular novel collection. 75% of the subjects in <i>Grandison</i> and <i>Pamela</i> cross-reference another section (107 out of the total 142 headings in Grandison and 92 out of the 122 sections in <i>Pamela</i>). In <i>Clarissa</i>, the first novel that Richardson ‘commonplaced’, only 26% of the headings cross-reference another topic. This suggests that as Richardson was creating the collection of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, the networked nature of the work became more critical to his project.</p>
