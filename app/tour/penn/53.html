	<h2>5. Beyond the Maxim</h2>
	<p>In addition to the moral maxims—pithy statements of advice and morality—Richardson uses characters as a way to guide and ‘teach’ his readers.</p>
	<p>On this page, for example, a section on the “Histories and Characters of particular Ladies” is included in the <i>Pamela</i> section. The book points to “The history of Prudentia”  as a model of a “fine character” and “happy marriage.” In each case, the 'history' refers to a story that is being recounted, orally, <i>within</i> the novel. The stories of Coquetilla, Prudiana, Profusiana, and Prudentia are told as "<i>Woman's</i> Stor[ies]" to teach "young Ladies" to watch over their reputations" (419).</p>
	<p>By framing these stories in this way, Richardson suggests that literary characters are extractable from the greater narrative: minor characters like Coquetilla and even major characters like Pamela can be pulled out and use as an example. Entire mini-narrations, rather than just phrases and sayings, are plucked out of the larger narration to be read or returned to separately. In this way, Richardson encourages desultory reading practices like those expected from the Bible: reading for independent parables and stories <i>in addition to</i> the larger narrative.</p>
	<p>Many of these life histories are offered as ‘negative examples,’ including the “faulty education[s]” of Coquetilla, Prudiana, and Profusiana. These life histories, then, offer both positive models for readers to emulate and cautionary tales.</p>
