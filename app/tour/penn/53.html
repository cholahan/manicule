	<h2>5. Beyond the Maxim</h2>
	<p>In addition to the moral maxims we have been discussing, Richardson uses character as a way to guide and ‘teach’ his readers.</p>
	<p>On this page, for example, a section on the “Histories and Characters of particular Ladies” is included under <i>Pamela</i>. The book points to “The history of Prudentia”  as a model of a “fine character” and “happy marriage.” In each case, the ‘history’ refers to a story that is being recounted orally within the novel. The stories of Coquetilla, Prudiana, Profusiana, and Prudentia are told as “<i>Woman's</i> Stor[ies]” to teach “young Ladies” to watch over their reputations" (419).</p>
	<p>In isolating these ‘histories’, Richardson suggests that literary characters, like maxims, are extractable from the greater narrative, from minor characters like Coquetilla to major characters like Pamela. Entire mini-narrations, rather than just phrases and sayings, are plucked out of the larger narration to be read or reread separately. In this way, Richardson encourages desultory reading practices like those expected from the Bible: reading independent parables and stories <i>as well as</i> reading the larger narrative as a whole.</p>
	<p>Many of these life histories are offered as ‘negative examples,’ including the “faulty education[s]” of Coquetilla, Prudiana, and Profusiana.</p>
