	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>As noted in one of the introductory tour stops (<a href=86 target="_blank">here</a>), maxims are short, pithy quotations that were expected to be amassed throughout one’s reading, often <i>literally</i> in the form of commonplace books. Writing on commonplace books, the Roman philosopher Seneca urged readers to “copy the bees, and sift whatever we have gathered from a varied course of reading, for such things are better preserved if they are kept separate; then… we could so blend those several flavors into a delicious compound that, even though it betrays it origin, yet it nevertheless is clearly a different thing from what whence it came” (<i>Letters from a Stoic</i>, <a href=”https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_84” target="_blank">Letter LXXXIV,</a> “On Gathering Ideas).”
	<p>The maxims or ‘sentiments’ that Richardson extracted from his three novels are simple and straightforward, often lacking the poetic nature commonly found in most commonplace book quotations. On this page, in the only quotation on “Stile <i>in Writing</i>,” we find the declaration:</p>
	<p><i>”No Stile in Writing can be commendable, which is not plain, simple, easy, natural and unaffected”</i></p>
	<p>Many of Richardson’s sentiments follow this rule, offering straightforward advice. The quotation on “Spiritual Pride,” for example, reads:</p>
	<p><i>Spiritual Pride is the most dangerous and the most arrogant of all sorts of Pride”</i></p>
	<p>As noted in an earlier <a href=108 target="_blank">tour stop</a>, in some cases Richardson actually strips the quotations of their poetic language: distilling, ostensibly, the sentiments into more “plain” and “unaffected” language.</p>
