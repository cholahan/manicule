	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>In transforming his novels into maxims, Richardson also frequently made no other alterations than splitting longer passages into shorter statements. In the section on “Suicide,” for example, we are given a long passage from <i>Pamela</i> split into 8 sentiments. Richardson precedes these sentiments with the following context:</p>
	<p><i>“To the following effect reasons Pamela, at the pondside, when she laboured under a temptation to drown herself:”</i></p>
	<p>Why does <i>Moral Sentiments</i> not simply reproduce the long soliloquy as it is printed in the novel? What is breaking up the passage into shorter snippets actually <i>doing</i> to the text?</p>
	<p>In part, this quotation-splitting is indicative of the larger project of the book: showing that novels don’t have to be read <i>as</i> novels, or long passages be read linearly. Take for example, the following quotation from Pamela’s long thread of thoughts on suicide:</p>
	<p><i>“How do I know but the Almighty may have permitted these sufferings, as trials of my fortitude, and to make me wholly rely on his grace and assistance?”</i></p>
	<p>Taken as a whole, these quotations offer a case against suicide. This quotation, however, can also be read and survive independently, offering a singular argument against suicide: that suicide is simply another test, given by God, that one must prevail over. By isolating this quotation, the reader is taught to break down arguments into their collective parts, and to isolate certain fragments of novel from the whole. It also seems to imply that “moral lessons” can be better retained when broken into smaller parts: the reader should thus also decide which <i>parts</i> of the whole to harp on, copy, or memorize.</p>
