	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>In claiming to offer moral guidance, then, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> portrays itself as a secular extension of Biblical teachings. It was clearly a strategic choice, after all, for Richardson to ask Benjamin Kennicott, a biblical scholar, to write the preface.</p>
	<p>Here, in the preface, Kennicott discusses the failure of the Gospel alone to cultivate virtue, writing,</p>
	<p><i>“And yet, whatever improvements have been made by Christians in the system of Moral Duty; how powerfully soever men are now exhorted to act like reasonable and religious beings; how strongly soever those exhortations are enforced by the surer and more animating sanctions of the Gospel; yet—is it not too visible, that immorality and irreligion still obtain in the lvies of many, and, perhaps, (dreadful thought!) of the majority?”</i></p>
	<p>Kennicott goes on to say that many men, both of the “clergy and laity,” have sought to write texts to stop “this alarming denegracy from growing more prevalent” — including Richardson, in his novels <i>Pamela, Clarissa</i>, and <i>Grandison</i>. Richardson's <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, then, is framed as a secular work of morality that nevertheless builds on the Bible: attempting to further the work of the Bible where the Gospel has been ineffective.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> appears to be targeted at young women (as evident by the many sections dedicated to them, including <a href="16"target="_blank">Advice to young married Women</a> and <a href="16"target="_blank">Advice to Young Women</a> in <i>Pamela</i> and on “Advice and Cautions to Women” in both <a href="100"target="_blank"><i>Clarissa</i></a> and <a href="237"target="_blank"><i>Grandison</i></a>) and, to a lesser extent, at young men (especially in the sentiments pulled from <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>).</p>
