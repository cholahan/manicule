	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>In the <i>Grandison</i> section on “Poets,” Richardson even adds a maxim not present in the original novel:</p>
	<p><i>“Poets have finer imaginations that other men; but imagination and judgement seldom go together,</i></p>
	<p><i>Poets, when provoked, are the wasps and hornets of society.”</i></p>
	<p>The second part of the quotation, which is printed italics, was not taken from the original novel (see v.3, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=138" target="_blank">pp. 59</a>). It also does not appear to be a common maxim from this period, suggesting it was likely written by Richardson himself while compiling <i>Moral Sentiments</i>. The metaphorical use of “wasps and hornets,” however, would have likely be familiar to many readers. A famous maxim written by Jonathan Swift procalimed:</p>
	<p><i>“Laws are like cobwebs, which may catch small flies, but let wasps and hornets break through.”</i></p>
	<p>The phrase is taken from Swift’s <a href= "https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015078569145&view=1up&seq=180" target="_blank">“A Tritical Essay Upon the Faculties of the Mind”</a> (1707). It was later reprinted in Samuel Johnson’s Dictionary under <a href= "https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435030881114&view=1up&seq=411" target="_blank">“Cobwebs”
	</a> and became a popular proverb in England and <a href= "https://books.google.com/books?id=EuvqPkAq2bkC&pg=PA253&lpg=PA253&dq=maxim+Laws+are+like+cobwebs,+which+may+catch+small+flies,+but+let+wasps+and+hornets+break+through&source=bl&ots=1WtnSeeG9A&sig=ACfU3U1LFuGzycOWFq9z0YL3XbncwjYYLQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwia6trNvpXoAhWmknIEHZG2BDUQ6AEwDXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=maxim%20Laws%20are%20like%20cobwebs%2C%20which%20may%20catch%20small%20flies%2C%20but%20let%20wasps%20and%20hornets%20break%20through&f=false" target="_blank">America</a>.
	<p>We can conclude, then, that one of Richardson’s goals in creating <i>Moral Sentiments</i> was creating these types of maxims: quotations that would be frequently copied, in manuscript and printed form, travelling across different texts and even different continents.</p>
