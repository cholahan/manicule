	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>Richardson’s wish to emphasize different topics and moral lessons in each novels is magnified in the <i>Moral Sentiments</i>. In the section on <i>Pamela</i>, for instance, a unproportionately high number of quotations come from the fourth volume, about Pamela’s life as a wife and mother.</p>
	<p>The reasons seem to be twofold. First, Richardson explicitly argues that Pamela’s situation in the first two volumes is unique, and far from universal: on this page, he writes that</p>
	<p><i> “Tho’ <i>Pamela</i> made so great a figure in the station to which she was exalted, it is much more likely, that the generality of low-descended women, lifted up like her, would have their heads made giddy by their exaltation, than imitate her.”</i></p>
	<p>He insists that most marriages are happiest, on the contrary to Pamela’s example, when there is an “equality of birth and degree.” <i>Moral Sentiments</i> thus discourages its readers from taking the first two volumes as a moral guide. Most of the quotations about young women dealing with a rakish young man are pulled instead from <i>Clarissa,</i> which we might even consider a rewriting of these earlier <i>Pamela</i> volumes.
	<p>Secondly, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> seems to be highlighting quotations from <i>Pamela’s</i> fourth volume because most of Richardson&apos;s advice on education, raising children, and running a household can be found in that volume — there is simply less material on these topics within <i>Clarissa</i> and <i>Grandison</i>. The fact that Richardson sees his novels balancing these topics in this way — <i>Grandison</i> not needing a discussion on raising children because <i>Pamela</i> already has one — suggests that Richardson already considered his novelistic work as a cohesive whole: a collaboration that becomes visibly and <i>materially</i> manifested in this collection.</p>
