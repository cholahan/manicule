	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>It seems that Richardson’s goal for the <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is <i>not</i> just to supply his readers with more portable, digestible moral lessons -- free from the confines of the novel and its ‘distracting’ plot -- but also to instill an expectations for his readers to consistently <i>return</i> to passages from the novel. This expectation is not confined to this project alone.</p>
	<p>In this letter tacked on to the end of the book, for example, Richardson excerpts a long passage by Lucy Selby, using the character’s speech to explain his own position. He prefaces this quotation with the passage’s location in the original novel: it is an “omission in the Sixth Volume, Octavo, which is supplied p. 401, 402.”</p>
	<p>Within this quoted passage, Richardson uses a footnote to reference a passage that Lucy herself recalls during her speech, saying: “I remember the hind he gave to Father Marescotti (a).” These references are found in the original novels, as well. For example, in the second volume of <i>Grandison</i> on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=123"
	target="_blank">page 115</a>, a character references a letter they had received earlier, and that letter is footnoted with the location of the letter within the volume, on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=79"
	target="_blank">page 71</a>.</p>
	<p>This suggests that Richardson expected his readers to return to certains letters and passages throughout their reading of the novel as well as after. This type of referencing also emphasizes the importance of the very materiality of the book as a stable written record: the letters within each volume act as evidence and documentation that can be referenced and returned to -- by both the characters <i>within</i> the novels and the novels’ readers.</p>
