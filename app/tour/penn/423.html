	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>It seems that Richardson’s goal for the <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is <i>not</i> just to supply his readers with more portable, digestible moral lessons — free from the confines of the novel and its ‘distracting’ plot — but also to instill an expectations for his readers to constantly <i>return</i> to and re-read passages from a novel they have already read.</p>
	<p>This expectation is not confined to this project alone. In this letter tacked on to the end of the book, for example, Richardson excerpts a long passage by Lucy Selby, using the character’s speech to explain his own position. He prefaces this quotation with the passage’s location in the original novel: it is an “omission in the Sixth Volume, Octavo, which is supplied p. 401, 402.”</p>
	<p>Within this quoted passage, Richardson uses a footnote to reference an <i>additional</i> passage that Lucy is recalling herself during her speech, saying: “I remember the hind he gave to Father Marescotti (a)” and footnoting the referenced passage under (a). These types of references are found in the original novels, as well. For example, in the second volume of <i>Grandison</i>, on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=123"
	target="_blank">page 115</a>, a character references a letter they had received earlier, and the text footnotes the location of that letter (on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=79"
	target="_blank">page 71</a>), so that the reader can themselves return to the earlier letter.</p>
	<p>This suggests that Richardson expected his readers to return to certains letters and passages <i>during</i> their reading of the novel as well as after. This type of referencing also emphasizes the importance of the very materiality of the book as a stable written record: the letters within each volume act as evidence and documentation that can be referenced and returned to — by both the characters <i>within</i> the novels and the novels’ readers.</p>
