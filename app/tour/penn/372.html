	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>Though <i>Moral Sentiments</i> references the exact page of the novel which “contains” the sentiment, readers who refer back to the novel will still have to scour the page to find the sentiment’s original form. This can be especially confusing given that the sentiments can be an exact quotations extracted from the novel or a summary embodied by that scene. The second and third sentiments on this page, for example, read:</p>
	<p><i>“A generous person will make the generous confession of a fault easy to the contrite self-accuser,”</i></p>
	<p><i>“An error gracefully acknowledges, is a victory won, ibid"</i></p>
	<p>The sentiments are sourced from volume 2, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=278"target="_blank">page 270</a> (duodecimo). The first quotation is a summary of the dialogue between Sir Charles Grandison and his sister Charlotte in which he forgives her. Grandison’s words and actions thus becomes distilled into a pithier phrase, his character abstracted as an example of a “generous person.” The second sentiment, on the other hand, is taken word-for-word from the original passage.</p> 	<br />
