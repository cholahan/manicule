	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>Though each sentiment on the page references the exact page of the novel which “contains” it, readers who refer back to the novel will still have to scour the page to find the sentiment’s original form. This can be especially confusing given that the sentiments can be an exact quotation extracted from the novel or a summarizing maxims that epitomizes the moral tale of that scene. The second and third sentiments on this page, for example, read:</p>
	<p><i>“A generous person will make the generous confession of a fault easy to the contrite self-accuser,”</i></p>
	<p><i>“An error gracefully acknowledges, is a victory won,"</i></p>
	<p>The sentiments are sourced from volume 2, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=278"target="_blank">page 270</a> (duodecimo). The second sentiment is taken word-for-word from the original passage, and the reader will be able to quickly find it on the page. The first sentiment, on the other hand, is a summary of the dialogue between Sir Charles Grandison and his sister Charlotte in which Grandison forgives her. Grandison’s words and actions thus becomes distilled into a pithier phrase, his character abstracted as an example of a “generous person.”</p>
