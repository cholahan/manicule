	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>As explained in an <a href= "11" target="_blank">earlier tour stop</a>, commonplace books were touted as useful tools in which readers could save “universally” true maxims that they would be able to employ in their everyday lives.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> encourages this type of use. In the section on <i>Clarissa</i>, many of the sentiments ask the reader to “say” the quotations “with Clarissa.” On this page, for example, a quotation under “Forgiveness” reads:</p>
	<p><i>“An ingenious and worthy mind will say with Clarissa, ‘Spare me not because I am your Friend; but rather, for that very reason, spare me not.’”</i></p>
	<p>The quotation is taken almost word-for-word from Clarissa’s letter to Anne Howe, found <a href= "https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779712&view=1up&seq=63" target="_blank">on pp. 55, v.2</a>. It is particularly interesting that the maxim asks the reader to “say” the quotation “with” Clarissa: the book is asking the reader to imagine themselves as Clarissa — or temporarily in her place — and to mirror her exact words, and thus also her moral character. In short, the book asks the reader not only to <i>model</i> their lives after Clarissa, but to imagine themselves embodying her character during certain situations in their daily lives.</p>
	<p>This language is repeated in multiple sentiments in the <i>Clarissa</i> section. Under “Innocence,” we are told:</p>
	<p><i>“Happy is the person who can say with Clarissa, ‘I should be glad that all the world knew my heart. Let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions; fairly scann’d, I fear not the result"</i> (<a href=156 target="_blank">143-144</a>).</p>
	<p>Similarily, in the section on “Veracity,” we are told:</p>
	<p><i>“How glorious is it for a child to be able to say with Clarissa, that she never, to the best of her knowledge, told her mother a wilful untruth"</i> (<a href=221 target="_blank">208</a>).</p>
	<p>These three maxims illutrate how Richardson imagined his work being employed: just as earlier commonplace books were utilized for debate, the maxims in <i>Moral Sentiments</i> could be memorizing and later recited — though now in social situations, conversation, and in one's mind, rather than in oral arguments. The tool of the schoolhouse, in short, is transformed into the tool of the parlor room.</p>
