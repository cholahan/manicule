	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>As David Allen explains in <i>Commonplace Books and Reading in Georgian England</i> (2010), commonplace books from ancient Greece and Renaissance Europe were originally kept so that scholars could carefully “harvest” quotations that would later be employed in oral and written arguments (36). The tradition, then, was “firmly grounded in the technical concerns of the logician” (38). By the 18th century, however, when the commonplace book became more popular, especially in less scholarly settings and among women, the notion of its use also shifted. Readers were told to copy and re-read maxims so that they could apply the maxims’ sage advice to their own lives.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> encourages this type of use. In the section on <i>Clarissa</i>, many of the sentiments ask the reader to “say” the quotations “with Clarissa.” On this page, for example, a quotation under “Forgiveness” reads:</p>
	<p><i>“An ingenious and worthy mind will say with Clarissa, ‘Spare me not because I am your Friend; but rather, for that very reason, spare me not’”</i></p>.
	<p>The quotation is taken almost word-for-word from Clarissa’s letter to Anne Howe, found <a href= "https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779712&view=1up&seq=63" target="_blank">here</a>. It is particularly interesting that the maxim asks the reader to “say” the quotation “with” Clarissa: the book is asking the reader to imagine themselves as Clarissa -- or a duplicate of her -- by replicating her exact words and thus her moral character. In short, the book asks the reader not only to <i>model</i> their lives after Clarissa, but to imagine themselves embodying her character during certain situations in their daily lives.</p>
	<p>This language is repeated in multiple sentiments in the <i>Clarissa</i> section. Under “Innocence,” we are told:</p>
	<p><i>“Happy is the person who can say with Clarissa, ‘I should be glad that all the world knew my heart. Let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions; fairly scann’d, I fear not the result"</i> (<a href=156 target="_blank">143-144</a>).</p>
	<p>In the section on “Veracity,” we are told:</p>
	<p><i>“How glorious is it for a child to be able to say with Clarissa, that she never, to the best of her knowledge, told her mother a wilful untruth"</i> (<a href=221 target="_blank">208</a>).</p>
	<p>These maxims offer a view of how Richardson imagined these maxims being employed: just like the earlier tradition, quotes could be remembered and recited in speech, though in this case in social conversation, rather than oral arguments. The tool of the schoolhouse, in short, is transformed to the tool of the parlor room.</p>
