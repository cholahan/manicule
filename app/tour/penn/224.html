	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p><i>“The Vows of a maiden may be dispensed with by her Father when he hears them, Num XXX. 3, 4, 5. ibid.</i></p>
	<p>This maxim is taken from a footnote of <i>Clarissa</i>, which can be seen <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779712&view=1up&seq=222"target="_blank">here</a>. Both the footnote and sentiment reference the original ‘source’ of the maxim, the Book of Numbers in the Bible:
	<p>“If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father’s house in her youth;</p>
	<p>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.”</p>
	<p>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.”</i></p>
	<p>- Numbers 30:3-5. As quoted from the <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-30-3/"target="_blank">King James Bible</a>.
	<p>This is the rare case in which Richardson included a Biblical verse in the <i>Moral Sentiments</i>. The fact that the Bible verse was originally referenced in a footnote, rather than the main text, suggests that he imagines the reference acting as a type of reinforcement: the reader who might be tempted to disagree with Richardson’s claim is told to do so would be to <i>also</i> disagree with scripture.</p>
	<p>The scripture reference also reminds us that eighteenth-century readers were expected to constantly reference, return to, and re-read the Bible. In fact, we might say that <i>Moral Sentiments</i> frames Richardson’s original novels as similar to Scripture: Richardson acts his readers to treat the novels as authoritative material that should be constantly referenced and re-read.</p>
