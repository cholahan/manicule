	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>In a few rare cases, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> references and quotes from the Bible. Under “Vows,” we find the maxim:</p>
	<p><i>“The Vows of a maiden may be dispensed with by her Father when he hears them, Num XXX. 3, 4, 5. ibid.”</i></p>
	<p>This line is taken from a footnote of <i>Clarissa</i>, found on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779712&view=1up&seq=222"target="_blank">page 214</a> of volume two. Both the footnote and sentiment reference the original ‘source’ of the rule, the Book of Numbers in the Bible:
	<p><i>“If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father’s house in her youth;</p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.</i></p>
	<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.”</i></p>
	<p>— Numbers 30:3-5. As quoted from the <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Numbers-30-3/"target="_blank">King James Bible</a>.
	<p>The fact that the Bible verse is originally referenced in a footnote, rather than the main text of the novel, suggests that Richardson imagines the biblical quotation acting as a reinforcement of what he is already saying. In other words, the reader who might be tempted to disagree with Richardson’s claim about marriage is redirected to the footnote and told, there, that doing so would be disagreeing with <i>scripture</i>.</p>
	<p>These scriptural references also reminds us that eighteenth-century readers were expected to constantly reference, return to, and re-read the Bible. In fact, we might say that <i>Moral Sentiments</i> frames Richardson’s original novels as similar to Scripture: Richardson asks his readers to treat the novels as authoritative material to be constantly referenced and re-read.</p>
