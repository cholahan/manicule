	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Preface, written by the biblical scholar Benjamin Kennicott, lays out the purpose of the <i>Moral Sentiments</i>: to “render” Richardson’s novels “more completely useful” by isolating the moral and instructive elements of the narrative from the ‘distracting’ plot (vii). Kennicott writes:</p>
	<p>But as the narrative part of those Letters was only meant as a vehicle for the instructive, no wonder that many readers,, who are desirous of fixing in their minds those maxims which deserve notice distinct from the story that first introduced them, should have often wished and pressed to see them separate from that chain of engaging incidents that will sometimes steal the most fixed attention from its pursuit of serious truth” (ix).</p>
