	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<h3><i>Playing with organization</i></h3>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> uses its organizational structure to forefront certain topics and guide the reader to certain 'sentiments'. The organizational structure itself, then, becomes a medium through which to interpret and comment upon the original novel.</p>
	<p>The section on <i>Pamela,</i> for example, begins with "Address <i>to the Rich</i>," seperate from the section on <a href=80 target="_blank">"The Rich, Riches."</a> We can assume, then, that Richardson forefronts these sentiments for a particular reason: to immediately offer what <i>he</i> sees as the most important moral lesson of <i>Pamela</i>.</p>
