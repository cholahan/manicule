	<p>In many cases, then, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> offers a linear reading experience, despite its insistence that the reader can, and should, read through fragmentation. For example, in this section on “Example” from <i>Pamela,</i> the reader is given a passage split into five sentiments:</p>
	<p><i>What are twenty or thirty years to look back upon?<br> In a long life, what friends may we not have to mourn for?<br> What temptations may we not have to encounter with?</i> (v.6, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779662&view=1up&seq=119" target="_blank">pg. 111-112</a>).</p>
	<p>The final quotation (<i>”What temptations may we not have to encounter with?</i>) can only make sense when read after the earlier quotations, enforcing the need for some degree of linear reading. By breaking the sentiments up, however, Richardson encourages the reader to see the final sentiment <i>as</i> isolatable and extractable. The reader only has to change the beginning of the sentence for it to work independently: <p>“In a long life… <i>What temptations may we not have to encounter with?”</i></p>
