	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>The maxims, quotations, and references in Richardon&apos;s <i>Sentiments</i> are divided by novel (<i>Pamela</i>, <i>Clarissa</i>, and <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>), after which they have been organized by alphabetized subject. Progressing through the book from the <i>Pamela</i> section to the <i>Grandison</i> section, each novel section has slightly more subjects while the number of sentiments per subject <i>also</i> increases. Pamela has 123 subjects over 83 pages, with each subject section averaging about 0.7 pages. The <i>Clarissa</i> section has 134 subjects over 132 pages, with an average 1 page per subject, and the <i>Grandison</i> section has 142 topics over 179 pages, with an average of 1.3 pages per subject section.</p>
	<p>Like the project more generally, Richardson&apos;s alphabetized schema borrows a history of commonplace books. The concept of the commonplace book, which consists of collecting quotations under alphabetized headings, became especially popular <i>outside</i> of the classroom during the eighteenth century, perhaps in part due to John Locke&apos;s publication of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015010315821&view=1up&seq=607"target="_blank"><i>A New Method of a Common-Place-Book</i></a> in 1706. We can see that <i>Moral Sentiments</i> was clearly influenced by this new form of commonplacing outside of educational institutions.  Whereas earlier Renaissance commonplacing practices often replicated a few standardized headings, for example, Locke advocated for the reader to create original, personalized headings based on the content of their reading and their own interests.</p>

	<p> Similarily, Grandison individualizes the subject headings for each novel. For example, <i>Pamela, Clarissa,</i> and <i>Grandison</i> each have a section on "Anger", "Beauty", "Courtship", "Education", "Lawyers", "Libertines", "Love", and "Wit", among others. Yet there are also many subject headings that are found only within one novel section: Sir Charles Grandison has sections on <a href="/342"target="_blank">"Clandestine Marriages"</a>, <a href="/304"target="_blank">"Hospital(s) for Female Penitents"</a>, and <a href="/359"target="_blank">"Wedding-Day(s)"</a>; Clarissa has sections on <a href="/108"target="_blank">"Blushing"</a>, <a href="/133"target="_blank">"Eyes"</a>, and <a href="/200"target="_blank">"Rapes"</a>; and Pamela has sections on <a href="/23"target="_blank">"Children in their early infancy"</a>, <a href="/61"target="_blank">"Low Life"</a>, and specifically on the <a href="/70"target="_blank">"Poor not to be despised by the Rich"</a>.</p>
