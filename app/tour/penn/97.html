	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>The maxims, quotations, and references in Richardon&apos;s <i>Sentiments</i> are divided by novel (<i>Pamela</i>, <i>Clarissa</i>, and <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>), after which they have been organized by subject and then alphabetized. Like the project more generally, Richardson&apos;s alphabetized schema borrows a history of commonplace books. The concept of the commonplace book, which consists of collecting quotations under alphabetized headings, became especially popular <i>outside</i> of the classroom during the eighteenth century, perhaps in part due to John Locke&apos;s publication of <i>A New Method of a Common-Place-Book</i> in 1706. We can see that <i>Moral Sentiments</i> was clearly influenced by this new form of commonplacing outside of educational institutions.  Whereas earlier Renaissance commonplacing practices often replicated a few standardized headings, for example, Locke advocated for the reader to create original, personalized headings based on the content of their reading and their own interests.</p>
