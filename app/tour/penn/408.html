	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>Richardson&apos;s project is, at its core, also an indexing project. Each "sentiment" refers back to a page in the original novel, thus constituting an index to those novels: directing how a reader might recollect, return to, and reread each novel. The <i>Collection</i> is also indexed itself, which which has been reproduced with hyperlinks <a href=“/manicule/toc”target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> was certainly not Richardson's only foray into indexing. In <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i> (1753), Richardson included an <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=317"target="_blank">Index, Historical <i>and</i> Characteristical</a> in the sixth and final volume. Unlike <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, the index does not reproduce maxims, sumamries, or quotes, but rather gives page numbers for both topics (such as "Anger") and characters (such as "Anderson, <i>Captain</i>"). However, Richardson also includes a much shorter index of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=418"target="_blank">"Similes, and Allusions, in the Foregoing Six Volumes"</a> which refer to more maxim-like statements, such as "<i>Learned Woman</i>, To an owl among the birds" (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=420"target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
	<p>Richardson&apos;s interest with indexing might suggest a wish to elevate the novel genre at a time when it was often considered an inferior literary production. Janine Barchas claims in <i>Graphic Design, Print Culture, and the Eighteenth-Century Novel</i> (2003) that eighteenth century indexing, “especially pioneered in fiction by Samuel Richardson, signaled the genre’s literary gravitas” (174).</p>
