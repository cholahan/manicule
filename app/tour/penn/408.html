	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>Richardson&apos;s project is thus, at its core, an indexing project. The <i>Collection</i> contains a detailed index, divided by novel. You can find a hyperlinked, digital version of the book&apos;s index <a href="/manicule/toc"target="_blank">here</a>. The entire project of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, however, is also an index of the original novels. Each "sentiment" refers back to a volume and page in the original novel, thus constituting an index to those novels: directing how a reader might recollect, return to, and reread each novel. </p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i> was certainly not Richardson's only or first foray into indexing. In 1751, Richardson included a collection of sentiments appended to <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779662&view=1up&seq=391"target="_blank"><i>Clarissa</i></a>. In 1753, Richardson included two appendices to an edition of <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>. The first appendix is titled an <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=317"target="_blank">"Index, Historical <i>and</i> Characteristical, to the six volumes of this work."</a> Unlike <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, the index does not reproduce quotations or offer summaries, but rather only gives the page number references for its topics (such as "Anger") and literary characters (such as "Anderson, <i>Captain</i>"). Richardson also includes a much shorter index of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=418"target="_blank">"Similes, and Allusions, in the foregoing six volumes,"</a> which refer to (rather than reproduce) maxims and literary phrases within the novel, such as "<i>Learned Woman</i>, To an owl among the birds" (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=420"target="_blank">408</a>).

	<p>Richardson&apos;s interest with indexing might suggest a wish to elevate the novel genre at a time when it was often considered an inferior literary production to poetry and drama. As Janine Barchas claims in <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Graphic_Design_Print_Culture_and_the_Eig/Ll1hhbKSw4cC?hl=en&gbpv=0"target="_blank"><i>Graphic Design, Print Culture, and the Eighteenth-Century Novel</i></a> (2003), eighteenth century indexing, “especially pioneered in fiction by Samuel Richardson, signaled the genre’s literary gravitas” to its readers (174).</p>
