	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>We find a similar case here, in the section on Heath in <i>Clarissa</i>. Richardson quotes Joseph Addison - though he employs Addison's words on liberty to comment, instead, on health:</p>
	<p><i>“What Mr. Addison says of Liberty, may, with still greater propriety, be said of Health; for what is Liberty itself without Health?<br />It makes the gloomy face of Nature gay;<br />Gives beauty to the Sun, and pleasure to the Day.”</i></p>

	<br />
	<p>The following two lines reprinted here are also credited to Addison in the original passage from <i>Clarissa</i> on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779670&view=1up&seq=40 "target="_blank">page 30</a> of volume six. The lines are taken from Addison's poem <a href="https://archive.org/details/worksrighthonou03bohngoog/page/n110/mode/1up" target="_blank">“To the Right Honourable the Lord Halifax,</a> an earlier draft of Addison's <i>A Letter from Italy</i> (1704). The original lines read:</p>
	<p><i>“O Liberty— [...]<br />Thou mak'st the gloomy face of Nature gay,<br />Giv'st beauty to the sun, & pleasure to the day”</i></p>
