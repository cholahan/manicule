	<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
	<p>Richardson published <i>A Collection of Moral Sentiments</i> in the March of 1755. The book contains maxims, aphorisms, advice, and sayings from Richardson’s three novels: <a href="/pamela"target="_blank">Pamela</a>, <a href="/clarissa"target="_blank">Clarissa</a>, and <a href="/grandison"target="_blank">Sir Charles Grandison</a>. The ‘sentiments’ found in these pages are quotations from the original novels, pithy statements that summarize a moral or lesson of the novel, or references to passages in the original book. They are organized by novel and then by topic: (see a digitized <a href="/toc"target="_blank">index</a>).
