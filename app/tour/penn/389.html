	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>In line with Johnson&apos;s <i>Dictionary</i> and other reference works, Richardson includes internal references within his work, guiding the reader to turn to other pages. In doing so, Richardson creates an elaborate network — not only externally, connecting to the three novels, but also internally, between subject sections.</p>
	<p>On this page, we see that Richardson added additional headings that only exist to redirect readers to other headings. For example, a reader who turns to "W" to read about "Wickedness" is redirected to "Vice."</p>
	<p>From this, we can assume that Richardson expected his readers to dip in and out of the book, rather than read from beginning to end. </p>
	<p>Perhaps to a greater extend than they aid the reader, these heading redirections give the reader a <i>sense</i> of an intertwined network. Many of the suggestions are quite redundant: the text suggests, for example, that for “unhappiness” a reader should refer to “happiness”. This suggests that the excessive cross-references might have been included not only to ease the reading experience, but, in many cases, in order to facilitate an understanding of the book <i>as</i> a complex interconnected system, while imitating the authority of a reference work.</p>
	<p>While the Clarissa section has none of these stand-alone cross references, the Pamela section has 15 and the Grandison section 82. In the Grandison collection, they clutter the page; under ‘V’ and ‘W’, for example, eight are inserted consecutively. </p>
