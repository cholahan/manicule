	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>In line with Johnson&apos;s <i>Dictionary</i> and other reference works, Richardson includes internal references within his work, guiding the reader to turn to other pages. In doing so, Richardson creates an elaborate network—both externally, with his three novels-and internally.</p>
	<p>On this page, we see that Richardson created multiple headings that guide the readers to similar themes, so that a reader who turns to "W" to read on "Wickedness" will be redirected to "Vice."</p>
	<img src="images/ms_5.png" alt="" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
	<p>This suggests that Richardson imagined readers approaching his book by dipping into sections, desultorily reading, rather than reading through the entire text.</p>
	<p>These redirections, however, might be more useful in giving the reader a <i>sense</i> of an intertwined network than in actually aiding the reader. Many of the suggestions are quite redundant: the text suggests, for example, that for “unhappiness” a reader should refer to “happiness”. This suggests that the excessive cross-references might have been included not only to ease the reading experience, but, in many cases, in order to facilitate an understanding of the book <i>as</i> network while imitating the authority of a reference book.</p>
	<p>While the Clarissa section has none of these stand-alone cross references, the Pamela section has 15 and the Grandison section 82. In the Grandison collection, they clutter the page; under ‘V’ and ‘W’, for example, eight are inserted consecutively. </p>
