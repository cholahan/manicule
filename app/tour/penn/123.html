	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>In some cases, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> seems to references longer passages because it is the novelistic scene itself — its poetic language, dialogue, or the conduct of the character — that provides the moral lesson. In other words, these references imply that the moral lesson <i>cannont</i> be extracted or summarized from its larger novelistic context.</p>
	<p> On this page, for example, under “Death. Dying,” the reader is told to:</p>
	<p><i>“See Clarissa’s noble behavior in the agonies of Death,”</i>  <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201717&view=1up&seq=314"target="_blank">vii. 85 to 90.</a> [viii. 3-8].
	<p>The reader who consults the section on death, perhaps expecting to find a few memorable maxims, is instead redirected to read a six page letter and make their <i>own</i> interpretation and meaning.</p>
	<p>These references also enable the book to act as a jumping-off point for re-reading the novel.  A reader who wants to return to the scene of Clarissa’s death — perhaps to silently reread to themselves after a friend's passing, or to read aloud to a friend who has never read Clarissa — can quickly consult <i>Moral Sentiments</i> to find its exact location.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i>, then, offers multiple ways for the reader to utilize it, and multiple strategies by which to return — directly or indirectly — to the original novels.</p>
