	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>In certain cases, the book references these passages because it is the novelistic scene itself -- its poetic language, dialogue, and behavior of the character -- that offer a moral model. On this page, under “Death. Dying,” the reader is told to:</p>
	<p><i>“See Clarissa’s noble behavior in the agonies of Death,”</i>  <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201717&view=1up&seq=314"target="_blank">vii. 85 to 90.</a> [viii. 3-8].
	<p>The reader who consults the section on death, perhaps expecting to find a few memorable maxims, is instead redirected to read a six page letter and make their <i>own</i> interpretation and meaning. On the other hand, it also enables the book to act as a jumping-point for re-reading specific moments of the novel. A reader who wants to return to the scene of Clarissa’s death -- perhaps to silently reread to themselves, or read aloud to family members or a friend -- can quickly consult <i>Moral Sentiments</i> to find its exact location.</p>
	<p><i>Moral Sentiments</i>, in short, offers multiple ways for the reader to utilize it, and multiple strategies by which to return, directly or indirectly, to the original novels.</p>
