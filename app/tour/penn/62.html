	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>In many cases, then, Richardson transforms the sentiments  extracted from novels to conform to this idea of “plain, simple, [and] easy,” language.  In this section on “Low Life” from <i>Pamela,</i> for example, almost all of these lines are taken from one section of the novel in which Pamela has transcribed “a Manuscript Poem, in Mr. B’s Possession, written in Answer to a Friend, who recommend a poor Man of Genius to the Favour of the Author, in order to induce the benevolent Gentleman to lift him into a higher Life…” (<i>Pamela</i>, v.3, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201774&view=1up&seq=350" target="_blank">pg. 338</a>).
	<p>Consult the following quotation from this section:</p>
	<p><i>“The peer and peasant are equally links of the great chain of nature, and equally useful in it”</i></p>
	<p>The lines are taken from the following section of the manuscript poem:</p>
	<p><i>“Nor let the Peer the Peasant’s Lot disdain;<br> Each link, howe’er remote, connects the Chain.<br> Both but two diff’rent Marks, in one great View,<br> Extend God’s Landscape, and adorn it, too”</i> (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201774&view=1up&seq=354" target="_blank">pg. 342</a>)</p>
	<p>In transforming poetry into prose, it becomes evident that, for the most part, Richardson valued prose over poetry for teaching moral lessons.</p>
