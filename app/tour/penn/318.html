	<h2>2. Organizational Structure</h2>
	<p>The taxonomical nature of the work aligns the <i>Collection</i> with not only Locke&apos;s commonplace method but also with reference books: texts, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, which store and manage information. As Ann M. Blair outlines in <i>Too Much to Know: Managing Scholarly Information before the Modern Age</i> (2010), reference books are characterized by "large-scale compilation, finding devices, and layouts to facilitate consultation reading" (9).</p>
	<p>As a printer himself, it is likely that Richardson was active in deciding the <i>Collection&apos;s</i> graphic design. If we compare this 1755 <i>Collection</i> with his earlier efforts to commonplace his novel, his collection of sentiments appended to the 1751 <i>Letters and passages restored from the original manuscripts of the History of Clarissa</i>, it is clear that while he increased graphical elements to emphasize the book as a reference work. While Richardson, for the most part, keeps the same quotations, headings, and orderings of the original 1751 <i>Collection</i> in the Clarissa section (1), he has rethought some of the overall organization and design elements of creating a collection of sentiments.</p>
	<p>First, as we can see with the "L." on this page, Richardson adds alphabetical headings to the 1755 <i>Collection</i>. Given that these headings wouldn&apos;t necessarilly increase the ease at which a reader could navigate the book, I suggest that the headings were added to align the book with dictionaries and encyclopedias, both newer and increasingly-popular genres. As evident from the image below, Samuel Johnson&apos;s <i>Dictionary</i>, published in the same year, used similar capital letters to orient its reader.

	<p>In addition, Richardson formats his 1755 <i>Sentiments<i/> to break up the blocks of text within each section. In his 1751 appendix collection, Richarson uses drop caps for the first sentiment (so that the first letter of the first sentiment is significantly larger), thus visually signifying that each section can, and perhaps should, be read as a continuous block of prose. In this 1755 collection, Richardson uses small capitals on the first word for every sentiment rather than employing drop caps. In addition, he inserts page numbers at the end of each sentiment, which constantly draws the reader <i>outside</i> of the book, rather than to the next sentiment. By visually segmenting each sentiment, Richardson discourages a continuous, linear reading of the text while aligning it, graphically, with other reference works.</p>

	<p>(1) For example, in <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, 80 of the 81 sentiments under "Advice <i>and Cautions to Women</i>" are replicated exactly from his 1751 appendix.</p>
