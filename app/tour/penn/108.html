	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>The fact that Richardson is quoting external sources, however, is not always evident to the reader of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>. See, for example, the second maxim on “Beauty” in <i>Clarissa</i>:</p>
	<p><i>“Tho’ Beauty is generally the creature of fancy, yet are there some who will be Beauties in every eye,”</i> <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779720&view=1up&seq=214"target="_blank">i. 196.</a> [203].</p>
	<p>If we return to the referenced <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779720&view=1up&seq=214"target="_blank">page</a> of <i>Clarissa</i>, we find that Richardson is combining and condensing the sentiments found in the poetry of Dryden, Cowley, and Shakespeare. In returning to the novel, then, the reader might also be tempted to commonplace these poetic lines themselves, or even return to the original poems from which the lines are extracted — thus expanding their sense of the textual network encapsulated in <i>Moral Sentiments</i>.
