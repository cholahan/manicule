	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>These quotations, however, are not always evident to the reader of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>. See, for example, the second maxim under “Beauty”:</p>
	<p><i>“Tho’ Beauty is generally the creature of fancy, yet are there some who will be Beauties in every eye,”</i> <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779720&view=1up&seq=214"target="_blank">i. 196.</a> [203].</p>
	<p>If we return to the referenced <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779720&view=1up&seq=214"target="_blank">page</a> of <i>Clarissa</i>, we find that Richardson is combining and condensing the sentiments found in the poetry of Dryden, Cowley, and Shakespeare. By returning to the novel, then, the reader might also be tempted to commonplace these poetic lines or return to the original poems from which they are extracted -- thus expanding their sense of the textual network encapsulated in <i>Moral Sentiments</i>.
		<p>See also the maxim on Health in Clarissa, <a href=148 target="_blank">page 135</a>: “In Health every hope rises upon us…”, quoting poetry by Addison. Printed as a quotation in the original novel (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779670&view=1up&seq=40 "target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
