	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>In some cases, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> does not reproduce a quote or offer a summary, but instead refers back to a particular passage from the novel to which the reader should consult. On this page, for example, the book offers mutliple pieces of advice on rape, and then provides multiple passages for the reader to consult to continue reading about the subject: they can “See Mrs. Howe’s further arguments on this head” as well as Dr. Lewen’s arguments, and Clarissa’s responses to him.</p>
	<p>These references illustrate the generic diversity of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>: rather than just limit his book to sentiments and maxims, Richardson allowed it to also act purely as a reference tool, referring to entire letters and passages that could not, ostensibly, be summarized in such a pithy form.</p>
