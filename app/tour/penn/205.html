	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>In some cases, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> does not reproduce a quote or summary, instead refering back to a particular passage from the novel to which the reader should consult. On this page, for example, the book refers to multiple passages to which the reader can turn to continue reading about rape: they can “See Mrs. Howe’s further arguments on this head” as well as Dr. Lewen’s arguments and Clarissa’s responses to him.</p>
	<p>These references show the generic diversity of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>: rather than just limit his book to sentiments and maxims, Richardson allowed it to also act as purely a reference tool, referring to entire letters and passages that could not, ostensibly, be summarized in such a pithy form.</p>
