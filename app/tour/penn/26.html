	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>This web of connections between <i>Moral Sentiments</i> and Richardson’s novels is at times extended further, when the novel itself refers to external texts. On this page, for example, we find the maxim:</p>
	<p><i>“No part of this superiority will be hereby lost, says Mr Locke; but the distinction increased, and their authority strengthened, when love in inferiors is joined with outward respect, and an esteem of the person has a share in their submission</i>,” iv. 360. [<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201832&view=1up&seq=324 "target="_blank">314</a>].
	<p>If we return to the referenced <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201832&view=1up&seq=324 "target="_blank">page</a> in Pamela, we find a footnote redirecting us to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4LJKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=but+the+distinction+increased,+and+their+authority+strengthened,+when+love+in+inferiors+is+joined+with+outward+respect,+and+an+esteem+of+the+person+has+a+share+in+their+submission+%22thoughts+concerning+education%22&source=bl&ots=X24rEsuzGQ&sig=ACfU3U2VyxxeimXYjJ9DcqsZC2HgnWn3HQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5rc7H367nAhWOZd8KHWl8BUkQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=but%20the%20distinction%20increased%2C%20and%20their%20authority%20strengthened%2C%20when%20love%20in%20inferiors%20is%20joined%20with%20outward%20respect%2C%20and%20an%20esteem%20of%20the%20person%20has%20a%20share%20in%20their%20submission%20%22thoughts%20concerning%20education%22&f=false "target="_blank">page 298</a> of Locke’s “Thoughts Concerning Education.” These moment magnify the networked feeling of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>: at each step, the reader is referenced elsewhere, allowing them to find multiple layers to a single maxim. This maxim, for example, is read not only in isolation, but can be read in the context of a specific part of <i>Pamela</i> and in the context of Locke's original text.</p>
