	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>In many cases, then, Richardson alters the wording of the quotation to fit into a more conventional understanding of a popular maxim: pithy, figurative, and memorable. On this page, for example, in quotations under “Oeconomy,” we find the following maxim:</p>
	<p><i>“A wise man will plant, as well as cut down”</i></p>
	<p>The maxim is taken from a much longer passage in which Sir Charles discusses the management of his estate and the “methods he intended to take with regard to his way of life.” During this discussion, Sir Charles proclaims that “he would plant an oakling for every oak he cut down, for the sake of posterity” (v.2, <a href=”https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043314&view=1up&seq=238” target="_blank">pg. 230</a>).</p>
	<p>Richardson uses this land management as a larger metaphor for a “way of life,” shortening a long passage to a short phrase that might be easily memorized. In changing “plant an oakling for every oak he cut down” to “plant, as well as cut down,” however, he also simplifies the metaphor, making it abundantly clear that he is talking about ‘planting’ in a <i>metaphorical</i> sense.</p>
