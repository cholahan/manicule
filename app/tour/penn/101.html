	<h2>5. Beyond the Maxim</h2>
	<p>The <i>Clarissa</i> section is, especially, filled with these negative examples. Rather than exclude Lovelace from <i>Moral Sentiments,</i> Richardson uses Lovelace as negative example par excellence: not just as a caution for men, but also as a warning for women readers. On this page, for example, under “Advice <i>and Cautions to Women</i>,” the following maxim is included:</p>
	<p>“<i>I love, when I dig a pit, says Lovelace, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet and open eyes; for then a man can look down upon her with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there?</i>” <a href="	https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779704&view=1up&seq=33"target="_blank">iii.25</a> [168].</p>
	<p>Lovelace becomes a source of knowledge for <i>women,</i> to an even greater extent  than he acts a negative example for men. By reading Lovelace’s thoughts and understanding his motivations, Richardson’s female readers can better understand libertines like Lovelace in their own lives — and thus better understand how to avoid men like him.</p>
	<p>We can see a similar example on <a href=105 target="_blank">page 92</a>, in which Lovelace is characterized as a prime example of the “true Libertine spirit”:</p>
	<p><i>“It would be as unpardonable in a Lady, says Lovelace (in the true Libertine spirit) to break her word with me, as it would be strange, if I kept mine to her. In Love cases I mean; for as to rest, I am an honest moral man,</i> <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779670&view=1up&seq=327"target="_blank">vi. 317.</a> [vii. 244].</p>
	<p>These quotations of Lovelace offer the <i>specific</i> language and arguments that libertines might use, supposedly allowing female readers to become familiar with the arguments so that they can recognize them in real-life encounters.</p>
