	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>Of course, the <i>Moral Sentiments</i> features not only by a complex web of cross-referencing between topics, but also constant references and redirections back to the novels themselves. As <i>Moral Sentiments</i> explains on the first page of every section, the page numbers refer to two different editions of each novel, allowing readers with both the octavo edition and duodecimo editions (“Editions of the Twelves”) of the novels to fully utilize the book.</p>
	<p> Every page of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> may link back to over a dozen pages from the original novel. The book itself, then, is never self-contained: at almost every point, it redirects the reader back to lines and even full letters in the novel. <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is such an interesting tests case, then, because it encourages desulatory reading: urging its readers to constantly skip between sections of sentiments, leaf through the novels, and re-read entire sections of novels they have presumably already read.<p>
