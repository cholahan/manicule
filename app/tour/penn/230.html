	<h2>3. Linking back to the novels</h2>
	<p>Of course, the <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is constituted not only by a complex web of cross-referencing between topics, but also by constant reference and redirection back to the novels themselves. As the book explains on the first page of every novel section, the numbers refer to two different editions, allowing readers with both the octavo edition and duodecimo editions (“Editions of the Twelves”) to fully utilize the book.</p>
	<p> Every page of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> may link back to over a dozen pages from the original novel. The book itself, then, is never self-contained: at almost every point, it redirects the reader back to lines and even full letters in the novel. <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is such an interesting tests case, then, because it encourages desulatory reading: for its readers to constantly skip between sections, leaf through their novels, and re-read entire sections of novels they have presumably already read.<p>
