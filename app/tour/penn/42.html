	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>In many cases, then, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> offers a linear reading experience, despite its insistence that the reader can, and should, read through fragmentation. For example, in this section on “Example” from <i>Pamela,</i> the reader is given a passage split into five sentiments:</p>
	<p><i>“Can the gluttonous father expect a self-denying son?<br> With how ill a grace must a man who will be often disguised in liquor, preach sobriety to his children?<br> An irreligious man, piety?<br> Will a parent, whose hands are seldom without cards or dice in them, be observed in lessons against the pernicious vice of gambling?<br> Impossible; except when the child, seeing the odiousness of his father’s vices, has the grace to set them up as a kind of sea-mark, to warn him to shun those rocks on which his father has split,”</i> iv. 366.

	" target="_blank">319</a>].</p>
	<p>When this passage is read in full, it becomes clear that these questions only offer different examples; the moral lesson hinges on the reader reading the last part, and understanding that a child <i>will</i> learn the vices of their father, unless the father frames them as a negative example. It is a somewhat different lesson to isolate a single sentiment, and ask, “<i>Can the gluttonous father expect a self-denying son?</i> The isolated fragment offers no alternative to the perpetuation of vices.</p>
	<p>What these different passages show, then, is that while <i>Moral Sentiments</i> was encouraging fragmented, desulatory reading habits, its sentiments still often hinged on the logic of linear reading. We can see both methods of reading operating at once, often to different ends.</p>
