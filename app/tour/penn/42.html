	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>In some cases, however, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> only allows for a linear reading experience, despite its insistence that the reader can, and should, read desultorily. For example, in this section on “Example” in <i>Pamela,</i> the reader is given a passage split into five 'sentiments':</p>
	<p><i>“Can the gluttonous father expect a self-denying son?</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">With how ill a grace must a man who will be often disguised in liquor, preach sobriety to his children?</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">An irreligious man, piety?</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">Will a parent, whose hands are seldom without cards or dice in them, be observed in lessons against the pernicious vice of gambling?</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">Impossible; except when the child, seeing the odiousness of his father’s vices, has the grace to set them up as a kind of sea-mark, to warn him to shun those rocks on which his father has split,”</i> iv. 366. [<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175035201832&view=1up&seq=329" target="_blank">319</a>].</p>
	<p>When this passage is read in full, it becomes clear that these questions only offer different examples; the moral lesson hinges on the reader reading the last part, and understanding that a child <i>will</i> learn the vices of their father, unless the father frames them as a negative example. It is a somewhat different lesson to isolate a single sentiment, and ask, “<i>Can the gluttonous father expect a self-denying son?</i> The isolated fragment offers no alternative to the perpetuation of vices, unless the last line is also included.</p>
	<p>What these different passages show, then, is that while <i>Moral Sentiments</i> encourages fragmented, desulatory reading habits, its sentiments still often hinged on the logic of linear reading. We can see both methods of reading operating at once, often to different ends.</p>
