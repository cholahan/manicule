	<h2>4. The Form of the Maxim.</h2>
	<p>However, while many of these passages are split into shorter sentiments, at times they only make sense when read linearly. On this page under “Single Women,” for example, we are given the following sentiments:</p>
	<p><i>“The longer a woman remains single, the more apprehensive she will be of entering into the state of wedlock,<br> At seventeen or eighteen, a girl will plunge into it, often without either fear or wit,<br> At twenty, she will begin to think,<br> At twenty-four, she will weigh and discriminate,<br> At twenty-eight, she will be afraid of venturing,<br> At thirty, will turn about, and look down the hill she has ascended, and sometimes rejoice, sometimes repent, that she has gained that summit, sola</i> (v.4, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112043298&view=1up&seq=150" target="_blank">pg. 140</a>)</p>
	<p>If we were to flip to this page and pick the third line as a random sentiment, then, we would be confused. We cannot read and understand the fragment <i>“At twenty, she will begin to think”</i> without reading the earlier lines. What, then, is achieved by splitting up these passages?</p>
	<p>First, the chopping up of prose constantly reminds the reader that they can <i>stop</i> reading at any moment, shifting to a later sentiment in the section, a different section altogether, or back to the novel. This visual effect of the split quotations thus emphasises and teaches a form of non-linear reading. Secondly, the splitting up of passages allows the reader to see the passage as a grouping of smaller components that might be picked out and re-arranged. A reader copying passages into their commonplace book, or into a letter to a friend, might simply copy the first sentiment (“The longer a woman remains single…”) and only one of the subsequent sentiments, such as (“At thirty…”), allowing them to ‘create’ -- or, in other words, isolate -- a sentiment specifically about women in their thirties.</p>
