	<h2>5. Beyond the Maxim</h2>
	There is evidence, however, that Richardson was anxious about his readers being able to identify which quotations in his <i>Moral Sentiments</i> offered positive models and which were being used as negative examples.  At the top of the section “Reflections on <i>Women</i>”, a note is included on how the section should be read:</p>
	<p><i>“Designed principally to incite Caution, and inspire Prudence, &c. by letting them know what Libertines and free Speakers say and think of the Sex</i>”.

	<p>On this page, in this section on "Repentance" in <i>Clarissa</i>, the editor includes a declaration <i>between</i> quotations: “<i>Lovelace lived not to repent!</i>”</p>
	<img src="images/ms_11.png" alt="Excerpt from page 189</i><" style="width:100%;height:auto;">
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>This declaration clarifies an early quotation, in which Lovelace claims that he wants
	“<i>one day</i> to be a reformed man,” and the one immediately after, in which Lovelace claims he <i>has</i> repented “a thousand times,” both found on <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435024779688&view=1up&seq=404
	" target="_blank">page 396</a>. It is likely that, as the editor, Richardson included this declaration to drive a "correct" reading of the character of Lovelace. By printing the declaration in a different font, Richardson calls attention to himself <i>as</i> editor and curator of not only this book, but of the reader’s reading experience in general: his work <i>in</i> the print shop, working with the physical books, adds editorial authority to his authorial one. His choice of a Blackletter typeface—which was used to print the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/homepage.html"target="_blank">Gutenberg Bible</a> and was most common in the 15th and 16th centuries—might signal more 'antiquated' knowledge and can thus be read as an added assertion of editorial authority.</p>
