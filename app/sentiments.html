  <h1>About the Book</h1>
  <p>Richardson’s <i>Collection of Moral Sentiments</i> was published on March 6th, 1755. The book contains maxims, aphorisms, advice, and sayings from Richardson’s three novels: <a href="/pamela"target="_blank">Pamela</a>, <a href="/clarissa"target="_blank">Clarissa</a>, and <a href="/grandison"target="_blank">Sir Charles Grandison</a>. The book was printed in duodecimo and was sold, bound, for 3s. 6d. Though there is no information on the print run, it was likely 1,000 copies. The work was not very popular, and never had a second edition. In fact, when Richardson was compiling <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, his friends and colleagues urged him to abandon the task and instead write a fourth novel. <i>Moral Sentiments</i> was a very different work than his earlier novels. In a letter to <a href="/reader/penn/6"target="_blank">Dr. Benjamin Kennicott</a>, the preface-writer for <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, Richardson denegrates his own work, writing:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“It is a dry Performance — Dull Morality, and Sentences, some pertinent, some impertinent, divested of Story, and Amusement; I cannot expect much from it, tho' enlivened by your kind and friendly Preface.”</p>
  <p>Richardson's humility, however, was likely partially for show; he was writing, after all, a friend who he had asked to attest to the value of the work in a Preface. Richardson must have seen some value in the work, given the tremendous investement he made in the work—compiling it and printing it himself. In response to criticism of the project, Richardson claimed that he was not seeking monetary success with this particular work:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“However, I can faithfully assure them [my friends], that this collection was set about, and carried through (and a very painful and laborious task it was) more with a view to do good, than to profit. I could not expect a great sale of it, though it is the pith and marrow of nineteen volumes, not unkindly received” (<i>Barbauld</i>, V, 48, July 17, 1755, as quoted in William M. Sale, <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001022722?type%5B%5D=all&lookfor%5B%5D=sale%20richardson%20bibliographic&ft="target="_blank"><i>Samuel Richardson, A bibliographical record of his literary career with historical notes</i></a>, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>Though Richardson’s authorship of the work is not explicitly stated on the title page, it was well known at the time that he himself compiled and authored the work. At the time of its publication, the <i>Monthly Review</i> wrote that it was a work “by Mr. Richardson himself” (96). As both prolific novelist and career printer, Richardson took the work of writing and editing <i>Moral Sentiments</i> into his own hands. On July 16, 1753, he wrote to a friend: “I am pretty forward with Sir Charles: But am perplexing myself with extracting Sentiments, &c. which I once though I could have left to another hand” (Forster MSS., XII, 1, f. 81, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>The history of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> begins with <i>Clarissa</i>. In 1750, Richardson printed “Meditations of Clarissa, Collected from the Sacred Books; and Adapted to the Different Stages of a Deep Distress; Gloriously ---- by Patience, Piety, and Resignation. Being those mentioned in the History of Clarissa, as drawn upon by her for her own Use. To Each which is ---,  A Short Historical Account, Connecting it with the Story.” However, according to Sale, no record of the work’s publication exists, suggesting that “Richardson used the entire issue as gift for his friends” (64). Of the thirty-six biblical “meditations” in this collection, only four were extracted from the novel itself. That same year, a reader sent Richardson a collection of his <i>own</i> sentiments collected from <i>Clarissa</i>. Seemingly inspired by his work, Richardson took this collection of sentiments and added to it, publishing the collection as an addendum to the third edition in 1751. In a letter dated May 3, 1750, Richardson describes this process:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“A Gentelman to whom I had not at the time the Pleasure to be known, having amused himself with collecting many of the moral Sentiments scatter’d thro’ the Volumes [of Clarissa], of which he was so good as to make me a Present, I think to enlarge his Collection, and insert it at the End of the Work” (Forster MSS., XV, 2, f. 85, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>The eighty-six page section was titled <i>Letters and passages restored from the original manuscripts of the History of Clarissa</i>.After publishing this appendix in 1751, Richardson also added an appendix to his 1753 edition of <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, a short index of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=418"target="_blank">"Similes, and Allusions, in the Foregoing Six Volumes"</a>; more information on this appendix can be found on <a href="/reader/penn/408"target="_blank">this tour stop</a>. After <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, Richardson went on to complete what would become the standalone work of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>.</p>
  <p>While <i>Moral Sentiments</i> builds off of a history of indexes and appendices, it follows most closely from the 1751 <i>Letters and passages restored</i>. The section of <i>Clarissa</i> under <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is copied almost exactly from the 1751 <i>Letters</i>. For example, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> has 81 sentiments under “Advice and Cautions to Women,” of which 80 of which are replicated from the 1751 collection.  The <i>Clarissa</i> headings remain the same in the 1751 Letters and the 1755 Collection, and the sentiments even generally retain the same order. In addition to adding sentiments from <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Grandison,</i> Richardson’s standalone collection had different graphical elements and, unlike the earlier version, included page numbers of where the original sentiments are found in the original novels.

  <p>While Moral Sentiments never saw a second edition, the work did find a second life in it’s reprinting of the sentiments on a deck of cards, advertised as “The New Impenetrable Secret; or Young Lady and Gentleman’s Polite Puzzle” (Sale 96). The set of cards, made from copper plates, were likely modeled off of Horace Walpole’s similar 1758 “Impenetrable Secret” playing cards. The playing cards sold for six pence, with a higher-end version selling for one shilling, from 1760 to 1785. In 1760, the London Chronicle described the “Impenetrable Secret” as: “an entire new Set of Entertaining Cards, neatly engrave on Copper-Plates. Consisting of moral and diverting Sentiments, extracted wholly from the much admired Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison. The whole designed, while they amuse and entertain, to establish the Principles of Virtue and Morality in the Minds of both Sexes” (96-97).</p>

  <h1>Richardson, the printer</h1>
  <p>Before Richardson published his first novel, <i>Pamela</i>, in 1740, he was an established printer. As Sale claims in <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001160543"target="_blank"><i>Samuel Richardson: Master Printer</i></a> (1950), “nor did his success as a novelist divert his interest from the affairs of his press. Writing was always an avocation” (4). Unlike many novelists of his day, then, Richardson was intimately involved in <i>all</i> aspects of his novels: not only in the writing, but in the editing, formatting, appendices, graphic design, and marketing. As Sale writes,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"> “Richardson, unlike the vast majority of novelists, was his own printer, and frequently his own publisher. He was in a position to write books, to print and publish them, and to advertise any of them in newspapers which he printed and in part owned” (<i>Samuel Richardson: A bibliographic record</i>, x).</p>
<p>Richardson began his career as apprentice to the printer John Wile between 1706 and 1715 in Golden Lion Court, on Aldersgate Street (Sale, <i>Master Printer</i> 7). Richardson went into business as a printer himself around 1719, first on Dorset Street in Blue Ball Court, and then, in 1721, in Salisbury-square (8). One of the most interesting aspects of Richardson’s career as a printer was the strides he made to break ties with booksellers: either by taking on or negating their role. As Sale describes,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">“He had foreseen that, with the rapid development in the physical facilities for making books, the printer would be overshadowed by the towering figures of booksellers. His rise to prosperity was marked by his acquisition of shares in the copyright of books, by his partnerships in newspapers, by his securing of government contracts, by his printing of the Philosophical Transactions for the Royal Society, by his monopoly rights in the printing of law books” (7).</p>
<p>Richardson also worked closely with booksellers, assisting them in preparing indexes, prefaces, and dedications and not only printing, but also compiling, “abstracts, abridgements, and compilations” (<i>A bibliographic record</i>, viii). Richardson’s interest in collaborating with booksellers—and, at times, even bypassing their need—made him uniquely positioned to not only market his novels, but fashion such a unique, indexical work as <i>A Collection of Moral Sentiments</i>.</p>
