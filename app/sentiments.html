  <h1>About the Book</h1>
  <p>Richardson’s <i>Collection of Moral Sentiments</i> was published on March 6th, 1755, and was sold as a duodecimo, bound, for 3s. 6d. Though there is no information on the print run, it was likely 1,000 copies. The work was not very popular, and never had a second edition. In fact, when Richardson was compiling <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, his friends and colleagues urged him to abandon the task and instead write a fourth novel. Richardson is quoted as claiming that was not seeking monetary success with the work:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“However, I can faithfully assure them [my friends], that this collection was set about, and carried through (and a very painful and laborious task it was) more with a view to do good, than to profit. I could not expect a great sale of it, though it is the pith and marrow of nineteen volumes, not unkindly received” (<i>Barbauld</i>, V, 48, July 17, 1755, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>Though Richardson’s authorship of the work is not explicitly stated on the title page, it was well known at the time that he himself compiled and authored the work. At the time of its publication, the <i>Monthly Review</i> wrote that it was a work “by Mr. Richardson himself” (96).</p>
  <p>The history of <i>Moral Sentiments</i> begins with <i>Clarissa</i>. In 1750, Richardson printed “Meditations of Clarissa, Collected from the Sacred Books; and Adapted to the Different Stages of a Deep Distress; Gloriously ---- by Patience, Piety, and Resignation. Being those mentioned in the History of Clarissa, as drawn upon by her for her own Use. To Each which is ---,  A Short Historical Account, Connecting it with the Story.” However, according to Sale, no record of the work’s publication exists, suggesting that “Richardson used the entire issue as gift for his friends” (64). Of the thirty-six biblical “meditations” in this collection, only four were extracted from the novel itself. That same year, a reader sent Richardson a collection of his <i>own</i> sentiments collected from <i>Clarissa</i>. Seemingly inspired by his work, Richardson took this collection of sentiments and added to it, publishing the collection as an addendum to the third edition in 1751. In a letter dated May 3, 1750, Richardson describes this process:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“A Gentelman to whom I had not at the time the Pleasure to be known, having amused himself with collecting many of the moral Sentiments scatter’d thro’ the Volumes [of Clarissa], of which he was so good as to make me a Present, I think to enlarge his Collection, and insert it at the End of the Work” (Forster MSS., XV, 2, f. 85, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>The eighty-six page section was titled <i>Letters and passages restored from the original manuscripts of the History of Clarissa</i>.After publishing this appendix in 1751, Richardson also added an appendix to his 1753 edition of <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, a short index of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=418"target="_blank">"Similes, and Allusions, in the Foregoing Six Volumes"</a>; more information on this appendix can be found on this tour stop: manicule/reader/penn/408. After <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, Richardson went on to complete what would become the standalone work of <i>Moral Sentiments</i>.</p>
  <p>While <i>Moral Sentiments</i> builds off of a history of indexes and appendices, it follows most closely from the 1751 <i>Letters and passages restored</i>. The section of <i>Clarissa</i> under <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is copied almost exactly from the 1751 <i>Letters</i>. For example, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> has 81 sentiments under “Advice and Cautions to Women,” of which 80 of which are replicated from the 1751 collection.  The <i>Clarissa</i> headings remain the same in the 1751 Letters and the 1755 Collection, and the sentiments even generally retain the same order. In addition to adding sentiments from <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Grandison,</i> Richardson’s standalone collection had different graphical elements and, unlike the earlier version, included page numbers of where the original sentiments are found in the original novels.

  <p>As both prolific novelist and career printer, Richardson took the hybrid work of writing and editing <i>Moral Sentiments</i> under his own hands. On July 16, 1753, he wrote to a friend: “I am pretty forward with Sir Charles: But am perplexing myself with extracting Sentiments, &c. which I once though I could have left to another hand” (Forster MSS., XII, 1, f. 81, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>While Moral Sentiments never saw a second edition, the work did find a second life in it’s reprinting of the sentiments on a deck of cards, advertised as “The New Impenetrable Secret; or Young Lady and Gentleman’s Polite Puzzle” (Sale 96). The set of cards, made from copper plates, were likely modeled off of Horace Walpole’s similar 1758 “Impenetrable Secret” playing cards. The playing cards sold for six pence, with a higher-end version selling for one shilling, from 1760 to 1785. In 1760, the London Chronicle described the “Impenetrable Secret” as: “an entire new Set of Entertaining Cards, neatly engrave on Copper-Plates. Consisting of moral and diverting Sentiments, extracted wholly from the much admired Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison. The whole designed, while they amuse and entertain, to establish the Principles of Virtue and Morality in the Minds of both Sexes” (96-97).</p>
