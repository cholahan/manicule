  <p>Richardson’s <i>Collection of Moral Sentiments</i> was published on March 6th, 1755. The book contains maxims, aphorisms, advice, and summaries from Richardson’s three novels: <a href="/moralsentiments/pamela"target="_blank">Pamela</a>, <a href="/moralsentiments/clarissa"target="_blank">Clarissa</a>, and <a href="/moralsentiments/grandison"target="_blank">Sir Charles Grandison</a>. The book was printed in duodecimo and was sold, bound, for three shillings and sixpence (3s. 6d). Though there is no information on the print run, it was likely 1,000 copies, the standard at the time. The work was not very popular, and never had a second edition. In fact, when Richardson was compiling <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, his friends and colleagues urged him to abandon the task and to instead write a fourth novel. And in a letter to <a href="/moralsentiments/reader/penn/6"target="_blank">Dr. Benjamin Kennicott</a>, the preface-writer for <i>Moral Sentiments</i>, Richardson even denegrates his own work, writing:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“It is a dry Performance — Dull Morality, and Sentences, some pertinent, some impertinent, divested of Story, and Amusement; I cannot expect much from it, tho' enlivened by your kind and friendly Preface.”</p>
  <p>Richardson's humility, however, was at least partially feigned; he was writing, after all, a friend who he was asking to attest to the value of the work in a preface. Richardson must have seen some value in the work, given the tremendous investement he made in the book — compiling it and printing it himself. Responding to criticism of the project, Richardson claimed that the project was not a failure because it held value beyond mere monetary success:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“However, I can faithfully assure them [my friends], that this collection was set about, and carried through (and a very painful and laborious task it was) more with a view to do good, than to profit. I could not expect a great sale of it, though it is the pith and marrow of nineteen volumes, not unkindly received” (<i>Barbauld</i>, V, 48, July 17, 1755, as quoted in William M. Sale, <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001022722?type%5B%5D=all&lookfor%5B%5D=sale%20richardson%20bibliographic&ft="target="_blank"><i>Samuel Richardson, A bibliographical record</i></a>, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>As both prolific novelist and career printer, Richardson took the work of writing and editing <i>Moral Sentiments</i> into his own hands. On July 16, 1753, he wrote to a friend: “I am pretty forward with Sir Charles: But am perplexing myself with extracting Sentiments, &c. which I once though I could have left to another hand” (Forster MSS., XII, 1, f. 81, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96). Though Richardson’s authorship of the work is not explicitly stated on the title page, it was well known at the time of publication that he himself compiled and authored the work. Shortly after it was published, the <i>Monthly Review</i> wrote that it was a work “by Mr. Richardson himself” (96).</p>

  <p>Richardon&apos;s <i>Collection of Moral Sentiments</i> borrows from a long tradition of manuscript commonplace books, which you can learn more about <a href="/moralsentiments/reader/penn/11"target="_blank">here.</a></p>
  <p>The history of the book's publication begins with Richardon&apos;s novel <i>Clarissa</i>. In 1750, two years after <i>Clarissa</i> was published, Richardson printed a short collection of “meditations,” titled <i>Meditations of Clarissa, Collected from the Sacred Books; and Adapted to the Different Stages of a Deep Distress; Gloriously ---- by Patience, Piety, and Resignation. Being those mentioned in the History of Clarissa, as drawn upon by her for her own Use. To Each which is ---,  A Short Historical Account, Connecting it with the Story.</i>  However, according to Sale, no record of the work’s publication exists, suggesting that “Richardson used the entire issue as gift for his friends” (64). In other words, though printed, the work was only privately circulated.  The work takes a very different form from Richardson&apos;s later printed commonplace books: the “meditations” are taken from the Scripture and applied to the novel, rather than taken directly from the novel itself.  Of the thirty-six biblical “meditations” in this collection, only four were extracted from the novel itself.</p>
  <p>That same year, an enthusiastic reader sent Richardson a collection of his <i>own</i> sentiments collected from <i>Clarissa</i>. Seemingly inspired by his work, Richardson took this collection of sentiments and added to it, publishing the collection as an addendum to the third edition of <i>Clarissa</i> in 1751. In a letter dated May 3, 1750, Richardson describes this process:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“A Gentelman to whom I had not at the time the Pleasure to be known, having amused himself with collecting many of the moral Sentiments scatter’d thro’ the Volumes [of Clarissa], of which he was so good as to make me a Present, I think to enlarge his Collection, and insert it at the End of the Work” (Forster MSS., XV, 2, f. 85, as quoted in Sale, pp. 96).</p>
  <p>The eighty-six page addendum was titled <i>Letters and passages restored from the original manuscripts of the History of Clarissa</i>.</p>
  <p>After publishing this appendix in 1751, Richardson went on to add two appendices to his 1753 edition of <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>. The first appendix is titled <a href="?"target="blank">“Index, Historical and Characteristical, to the six volumes of this work”</a>. Unlike <i>Moral Sentiments,</i> the index does not reproduce quotations or offer summaries, but rather only gives the page number references for its topics (such as “Anger”) and literary characters (such as “Anderson, <i>Captain</i>”). Richardson also includes a much shorter index of <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=418"target="_blank">“Similes, and Allusions, in the Foregoing Six Volumes”,</a> which refer to (rather than reproduce) maxims and literary phrases within the novel, such as “<i>Learned Woman</i>, To an owl among the birds” (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435027142132&view=1up&seq=420"target="_blank">408</a>).</p>
  <p>While <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is clearly a culmination of the project of these indexes and appendices, it follows most closely from the 1751 <i>Letters and passages restored</i>. The section of <i>Clarissa</i> sentiments within <i>Moral Sentiments</i> is copied almost exactly from the 1751 <i>Letters</i>. For example, <i>Moral Sentiments</i> has 81 sentiments under “Advice and Cautions to Women” in the <i>Clarissa</i> section, 80 of which are replicated from the 1751 collection.  The <i>Clarissa</i> headings remain the same from the 1751 Letters to the 1755 Collection, and the sentiments even generally retain the same order. However, in addition to adding the sentiments from <i>Pamela</i> and <i>Grandison,</i> Richardson’s standalone collection featured different graphical elements and, unlike the earlier version, included page numbers of where the original sentiments are found in the original novels.

  <p>While Moral Sentiments never saw a second edition, the work did find a second life in it’s reprinting of the sentiments on a deck of cards, advertised as “The New Impenetrable Secret; or Young Lady and Gentleman’s Polite Puzzle” (Sale 96). The set of cards, made from copper plates, were likely modeled off of Horace Walpole’s earlier 1758 “Impenetrable Secret” playing cards. The “<i>New</i> Impenetrable Secret,” cards, containing Richardson&apos;s sentiments, sold for six pence, with a higher-end version selling for one shilling, from 1760 to 1785. The London Chronicle described the “New Impenetrable Secret” in 1760 as:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“...an entire new Set of Entertaining Cards, neatly engrave on Copper-Plates. Consisting of moral and diverting Sentiments, extracted wholly from the much admired Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison. The whole designed, while they amuse and entertain, to establish the Principles of Virtue and Morality in the Minds of both Sexes” (96-97).</p>
  <p>Richardson&apos;s <i>Moral Sentiments</i> had found a more prosperous form as playing cards than it ever did as a reference book.</p>

  <p>Before Richardson published his first novel, <i>Pamela</i>, in 1740, he had already established a successful career and business as a printer. As Sale claims in <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001160543"target="_blank"><i>Samuel Richardson: Master Printer</i></a> (1950), “nor did his success as a novelist divert his interest from the affairs of his press. Writing was always an avocation” (4). Unlike many novelists of his day, then, Richardson was intimately involved in <i>all</i> aspects of his novels: not only in thier writing, but in their editing, formatting, appendices, graphic design, and marketing. As Sale writes,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px"> “Richardson, unlike the vast majority of novelists, was his own printer, and frequently his own publisher. He was in a position to write books, to print and publish them, and to advertise any of them in newspapers which he printed and in part owned” (<i>Samuel Richardson: A bibliographic record</i>, x).</p>
  <p>Richardson began his career as apprentice to the printer John Wile between 1706 and 1715 in Golden Lion Court, on Aldersgate Street (Sale, <i>Master Printer</i> 7). Richardson went into business as a printer himself around 1719, first on Dorset Street in Blue Ball Court, and then, in 1721, in Salisbury-square (8). One of the most interesting aspects of Richardson’s career as a printer was the strides he made to break ties with booksellers: either by taking on or negating their role. As Sale describes,</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px">“He had foreseen that, with the rapid development in the physical facilities for making books, the printer would be overshadowed by the towering figures of booksellers. His rise to prosperity was marked by his acquisition of shares in the copyright of books, by his partnerships in newspapers, by his securing of government contracts, by his printing of the Philosophical Transactions for the Royal Society, by his monopoly rights in the printing of law books” (7).</p>
  <p>Richardson also worked closely with booksellers, assisting them in preparing indexes, prefaces, and dedications and not only printing, but also compiling, “abstracts, abridgements, and compilations” (<i>A bibliographic record</i>, viii). Richardson’s interest in collaborating with booksellers—and, at times, even bypassing their need—made him uniquely positioned to not only market his novels, but fashion unique, indexical works such as <i>A Collection of Moral Sentiments</i>.</p>
