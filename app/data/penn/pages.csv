Kennicott was well-known for his printed sermons as well as his collations and printings of Hebrew manuscripts, including â€œVetus Testamentum Hebraicum cum variis lectionibusâ€ù (â€œThe Old Testament in Hebrew with various lessonsâ€ù) in 1776. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, the â€œscale of [his] textual criticism (he had consulted and collated 615 manuscript versions and 52 printed editions) gave Kennicott a European reputation that transcended national and denominational boundaries.â€ù It is very telling that Richardson asked a biblical scholar and sermon-giver to write the preface, framing his Collection as a virtuous and educational work. In the preface, Kennicott discusses the importance of secular morality in supplementing the Gospels and other religious works â€“ the importance of man developing a â€œmore perfect knowledge, not only of Religion, in matters relative to God, but of Virtue also, in matters relative to ourselves, and one anotherâ€ù (iv).7,2v,iv,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,8,3r,v,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,9,3v,vi,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,10,4r,vii,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,11,4v,viii,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,12,5r,ix,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,13,5v,x,Paratext,,,,,,,,,,,14,6r,1,Pamela,A: Address to the Rich,,,,,,,,,,15,6v,2,Pamela ,"A: Advantages of Men over Women, owing to Women Themselves;
